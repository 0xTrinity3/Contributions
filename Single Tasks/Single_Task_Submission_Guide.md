# Single Tasks Guide

## Introduction

This section is dedicated to contributors that either would like to submit a Single Task within Mor Labs. Here, you can learn more about the process as well as find out how to submit your contributions, ensuring continued transparency and alignment with our goals and standards. Following the process outlined below will help maintain the integrity of our collaborative efforts and reward system.

## FAQs

### Who can submit a contribution for a single task?

Anyone

### What kind of contributions can I submit? 

It's best to submit contributions that fall within one of the allocated funding pools. This ensures that a pre-approved budget is available for a given project or activity. Check the [Funded Pools Register](https://insert.com). 

This said, there is also a "Free Pool" that can accept contributions of any kind, providing they do not go against the [Mor Labs DAO Constitution](https://github.com/Morlabs/DAO). 

### What information do I need to submit and how do I submit?

To submit a Single Task Contribution, use the [Single Task Proof of Submission Table](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/single_tasks.md).

You will be asked to submit the following:

- **Ethereum/Wallet Address:** For reward reception. Include multisig if applicable.
- **Relevant Links:** Any pertinent issues, tasks, or your contribution link.
- **Expected Value:** In USD. For recurring tasks, indicate monthly value.
- **Contribution Description:** Detail the impact and nature of your work.

### Can I submit a contribution for a task that has already been submitted by somebody else?

In short, yes. Although you should try to ensure your contribution is unique or adds value beyond existing solutions. The competitive nature of our system promotes quality and innovation and for this reason, it is acceptable to submit tasks that overlap with prior submissions if you believe doing so would be in the best interets of Mor Labs.

### Where can I see which Single Tasks are completed, in progress or rejected?

View a list of the [Approved Single Tasks](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/single_tasks.md).

### How much will I get paid?
When you submit a Single Task, you include your desired Estimated Monthly Value in USD. This is what you believe would be a fair price for this contribution. The CRG will then review this and may approve, reject or speak with you to request a revision. 

If approved, the payout per contributor for a given approved Single Task is based on the following formula: 

(Estimated value for an approved Single task / divided by the total value for approved Single tasks across all contributors in a given month) * Finance Vault token supply * Pool Allocation %. 

[insert example] 

NB: The Estimated Monthly Value you enter on your task submission does not constitute in any way a legal agreement for MOR Labs DAO to pay you this amount. The CRG has full discretion to modify or nullify the amount as they see fit.  

### When will I get paid?

The CRG process batch payments for approved Single Task Contributions in the first week of the month for the proceeding month.
