# Monthly Proof of Contributions for Recurring Tasks

## Introduction

This section is dedicated to contributors with approved recurring-task roles within Mor Labs. Here, you can submit your monthly proof of contributions, ensuring continued transparency and alignment with our goals and standards. Following the process outlined below will help maintain the integrity of our collaborative efforts and reward system.

## Submission Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Contribution Report

Before submitting, prepare a detailed report of your contributions over the month, including:

- Summary of tasks completed.
- Links to deliverables, discussions, or any relevant work evidence.
- Any metrics or outcomes resulting from your contributions (if applicable).
- Reflections or feedback on the tasks (optional but encouraged).

### Step 2: Format Your Submission

Use the following Markdown template to format your monthly submission. This ensures consistency and ease of review.

(Note: Adjust the nested code block formatting as needed for your specific Markdown viewer or editor to avoid rendering issues.)

### Step 3: Submit Your Report

Create a new issue in the designated GitHub repository with your formatted report. Use a consistent naming convention for easy identification, such as "Monthly Contribution Report - [Your Role] - [Month, Year]".

### Review Process
The Contribution Review Guild (CRG) will review submitted reports to verify contributions and assess the ongoing impact of your work. Feedback or additional information may be requested. Ensure timely submission to facilitate the review process and subsequent reward disbursement.
