## FAQs

### Who can become an Approved Contributor for a Recurring Task?
Only Contributors that have **3 or more approved Single Task Contributions** will be eligible to be appointed for a Recurring Task. 

### How can I become an Approved Contributor for a Recurring Task?

If you're just starting out, you will first need to have **3 or more approved Single Task Contributions** as this is a requirement to be eligible to be appointed for a Recurring Task. This process ensures that a minimum trust level has been reached by a given contributor, before making them eligible to receive a continous stream with continous responsibility. 

If you've already met that requirement and would like become an approved contributor, let us know more about you and the recurring task you would like to be responsible for by [**submitting an application**](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/Recurring_tasks/applications_template.md).

### What kind of recurring tasks can I be responsible for? 

Check the community curated list of [Open Positions](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/Recurring_tasks/open_positions.md). Whilst not essential to be included on this Open Positions list, it's a good way to see if there is aleady an agreed upon need for a given position. 

NB: There is no requirement for a recurring task to be listed the Open Positions board. If you think a position should be added, you are either free to make a request to add this on the Open Positions board or if it's like a position you would like to do yourself,[**submitting an application**](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/Recurring_tasks/applications_template.md).

### Where can I see which recuring tasks are already being rewarded by other Contributors?

View a list of the [Approved Recurring Task Contributors](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/Recurring_tasks/recurring_task_positions.md). You should try to ensure your contribution is unique or adds value beyond existing solutions. The competitive nature of our system promotes quality and innovation. 

### How much will I get paid?
When you submit an application for a Recurring Task, you include your desired Estimated Monthly Value in USD. This is what you believe would be a fair price for this contribution. The CRG will then review this and may approve, reject or speak with you to request a revision. 

If approved, the payout per contributor for a given approved task as per the [Approved Recurring Task Contributors](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/Recurring_tasks/recurring_task_positions.md) is based on the following formula: 

(Estimated value for an approved recurring task / divided by the total value for approved recurring tasks across all contributors in a given month) * Finance Vault token supply * Pool Allocation %. 

[insert example] 

NB: The Estimated Monthly Value you enter on an application, even if that application is approved, does not constitute in any way a legal agreement for MOR Labs DAO to pay you this amount each month and the CRG has full discretion to modify or nullify the stream as they see fit. 

### When will I get paid?

Once setup, your stream will run continously and transfer tokens to each you each block. Being appointed for a Recurring Task still requires monthly work submissions. You are required to make your monthly submission within 7 days of the end of each month, otherwise your stream will be cancelled. 

### Where do I make the monthly submission?

Copy the [Monthly Contribution Template](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/Recurring_tasks/monthly_contributions/Template_month.md), fill it out with your own information to record what you have done in a given month. This includes; 

- Summary of tasks completed.
- Links to deliverables, discussions, or any relevant work evidence.
- Any metrics or outcomes resulting from your contributions (if applicable).
- Reflections or feedback on the tasks (optional but encouraged).

NB: You should use the following file name: "Monthly Contribution Report - [Your Role] - [Month, Year]".
