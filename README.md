# Contribution Guidelines

# Introduction

Welcome to Mor Labs! This guide is designed to help you navigate through the contribution process, whether you're looking to complete a single task or take on a recurring role. By leveraging your unique skills and interests, you can significantly impact our progress and innovation in the DeAI revolution. Here, you'll find everything you need to identify opportunities, submit contributions, and understand the rewards process.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Identifying Contribution Opportunities

At Mor Labs, your contributions are crucial to our development and growth. You can contribute through:

- **Single Task Contributions:** Defined projects or tasks with a specific goal.
- **Recurring Task Contributions:** Ongoing responsibilities requiring continuous attention.

Look for opportunities on platforms like Morpheus Dework, within our GitHub repositories, or initiate projects that align with our objectives.

Note that Recurring Task Contributions are only available for contributors to have at least 3 approved Single Task Contributions. 

A Single Task Contribution is compensated with a fixed amount based on an isolated task (ex: Translate whitepaper to Russian). By contrast, a Recurring Task Contribution is rewarded with a continous stream to reflect that there are ongoing responsibilities to this recurring task that require continous attention (ex: Discord community management). 

### Step 2: Submission Process

#### A) Single Task Contributions 

To submit a Single Task Contribution, use the [Single Task Proof of Submission Table](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/single_tasks.md). 

You will be asked to submit the following:

- **Ethereum/Wallet Address:** For reward reception. Include multisig if applicable.
- **Relevant Links:** Any pertinent issues, tasks, or your contribution link.
- **Expected Value:** In USD. For recurring tasks, indicate monthly value.
- **Contribution Description:** Detail the impact and nature of your work.

Ensure your contribution is unique or adds value beyond existing solutions. The competitive nature of our system promotes quality and innovation.

#### B) Recurring Task Contributions 

To submit a Recurring Task Contribution, use the [Recurring Task Proof of Submission Table](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/recurring_tasks.md).


You can view a list of the approved Recurring Task Contributors here. If you'd like to be included on this list, you can make your application here. Note that Recurring Task Contributions are only available for contributors to have at least 3 approved Single Task Contributions. 

Stream adjustments, including the creation, amendment or termination of streams to Recurring Task Contributors are made at the end of each month. 

To submit a Recurring Task Contribution for a given month, complete the Monthly submission form. Note, you are required to make your monthly submission within 7 days of the end of each month, otherwise your stream will be cancelled. 

## Governance and Fairness

Our governance is powered by [Hats Protocol](https://hatsprotocol.xyz), ensuring community-led decision-making. This enhances transparency and accountability across Mor Labs.

## Conflict Resolution

For disputes, especially regarding CRG decisions, the Arbitration Guild (AG) provides a structured resolution process, aligning with the [Mor Labs DAO Constitution](https://github.com/Morlabs/DAO) and community interests.

## Recurring Task Applications

For those interested in recurring tasks, more thorough vetting is required due to their ongoing nature.
