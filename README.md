# Contribution Guidelines

# Introduction

Welcome to Mor Labs! This guide is designed to help you navigate through the contribution process, whether you're looking to complete a single task or take on a recurring role. By leveraging your unique skills and interests, you can significantly impact our progress and innovation in the DeAI revolution. Here, you'll find everything you need to identify opportunities, submit contributions, and understand the rewards process.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Identifying Contribution Opportunities

At Mor Labs, your contributions are crucial to our development and growth. You can contribute through:

- **Single Task Contributions:** Defined projects or tasks with a specific goal.
- **Recurring Task Contributions:** Ongoing responsibilities requiring continuous attention.

Look for opportunities on platforms like Morpheus Dework, within our GitHub repositories, or initiate projects that align with our objectives.

### Step 2: Contribution Submission Process

To submit a contribution, include the following details:

- **Contribution Type:** Single or recurring task.
- **Ethereum/Wallet Address:** For reward reception. Include multisig if applicable.
- **Relevant Links:** Any pertinent issues, tasks, or your contribution link.
- **Expected Value:** In USD. For recurring tasks, indicate monthly value.
- **Contribution Description:** Detail the impact and nature of your work.

Ensure your contribution is unique or adds value beyond existing solutions. The competitive nature of our system promotes quality and innovation.

### Step 3: Rewarding Contributions

Submit your contribution along with the expected USD value. The Contribution Review Guild (CRG) will determine the reward based on its impact, which may vary from your expectations.

## Governance and Fairness

Our governance is driven by the Hats Protocol, ensuring community-led decision-making. This enhances transparency and accountability across Mor Labs.

## Conflict Resolution

For disputes, especially regarding CRG decisions, the Arbitration Guild (AG) provides a structured resolution process, aligning with the Mor Labs DAO Constitution and community interests.

## Recurring Task Applications

For those interested in recurring tasks, more thorough vetting is required due to their ongoing nature.
