# Contribution Guidelines

# Introduction

Welcome to Mor Labs! This guide is designed to help you navigate through the contribution process, whether you're looking to complete a single task or take on a recurring role. By leveraging your unique skills and interests, you can significantly impact our progress and innovation in the DeAI revolution. Here, you'll find everything you need to identify opportunities, submit contributions, and understand the rewards process.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Identifying Contribution Opportunities

At Mor Labs, your contributions are crucial to our development and growth. You can contribute through:

- **Single Task Contributions:** Defined projects or tasks with a specific goal.
- **Recurring Task Contributions:** Ongoing responsibilities requiring continuous attention.

Look for opportunities on platforms like Morpheus Dework, within our GitHub repositories, or initiate projects that align with our objectives.

Note that Recurring Task Contributions are only available for contributors to have at least 3 approved Single Task Contributions. 

A Single Task Contribution is compensated with a fixed amount based on an isolated task (ex: Translate whitepaper to Russian). By contrast, a Recurring Task Contribution is rewarded with a continous stream to reflect that there are ongoing responsibilities to this recurring task that require continous attention (ex: Discord community management). 

### Step 2: Submission Process

#### A) Single Task Contributions 

To submit a Single Task Contribution, use the [Single Task Proof of Submission Table](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/single_tasks.md). 

You will be asked to submit the following:

- **Ethereum/Wallet Address:** For reward reception. Include multisig if applicable.
- **Relevant Links:** Any pertinent issues, tasks, or your contribution link.
- **Expected Value:** In USD. For recurring tasks, indicate monthly value.
- **Contribution Description:** Detail the impact and nature of your work.

Ensure your contribution is unique or adds value beyond existing solutions. The competitive nature of our system promotes quality and innovation.

#### B) Recurring Task Contributions 

To submit a Recurring Task Contribution, use the [Recurring Task Proof of Submission Table](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/recurring_tasks.md).

Important, **before submitting a recurring task**: 

1. Only Contributors that have **3 or more approved Single Task Contributions** will be eligible to be appointed for a Recurring Task
2. View a list of the [Approved Recurring Task Contributors](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/Recurring_tasks/recurring_task_positions.md). Try to ensure your contribution is unique or adds value beyond existing solutions. The competitive nature of our system promotes quality and innovation. If you'd like to become an approved contributor, let us know more about you and the recurring task you would like to be responsible for by [**submitting an application**](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/Recurring_tasks/applications_template.md).
3. View a list of community curated [Open Positions](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/Recurring_tasks/open_positions.md). Whilst not essential to be included on this Open Positions list, it's a good way to see if there is aleady an agreed upon need for a given position. 
4. Stream adjustments, including the creation, amendment or termination of streams to Recurring Task Contributors are made at the end of each month. 
5. Being appointed for a Recurring Task still requires monthly work submissions. You are required to make your monthly submission within 7 days of the end of each month, otherwise your stream will be cancelled. 

## Governance and Fairness

Our governance is powered by [Hats Protocol](https://hatsprotocol.xyz), ensuring community-led decision-making. This enhances transparency and accountability across Mor Labs.

## Conflict Resolution

For disputes, especially regarding CRG decisions, the Arbitration Guild (AG) provides a structured resolution process, aligning with the [Mor Labs DAO Constitution](https://github.com/Morlabs/DAO) and community interests.
